We should, if possible, update our NPM packages weekly, for they too will decay
and reveal security vulnerabilities.

## Automatic dependency upgrades

Every week on Monday at 08:30 UTC, Dependabot will create a number of PRs for
updating our dependencies.

These will need to be reviewed and merged.

In some cases dependabot will not be able to upgrade a package due to tests
failing. In this case, you'll will have to manually review, and potentially
upgrade the dependencies manually. The instructions for this are below.

## Manual dependency upgrades

We usually have to do manual dependency upgrades when performing major version
upgrades, or when dependabot is unable to upgrade a package due to failing tests.

Here is a general workflow for so doing:

1. Dependabot will add some PRs for necessary dependency upgrades to our PRs
   list. This is your call to action, your batsignal!
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b initials/deps-y-m-d`.
3. Find the previous dependencies PR, which will have a list of packages which
   have been held back for various reasons.
4. Run `make upgrade` to see a list of all packages which
   _can_ be upgraded. Navigate the view with the arrow keys and select packages
   with Space. Confirm your upgrade changes with Enter.
5. Upgrade the packages in batches. First perform the semver patch and minor
   updates, followed by individual major updates, unless any of these updates
   are being held back.
6. After every batch, test the app by running commands such as `make dev`, `make build`, `make test`, `make cypress-{mocked|ete}{|-okta}`. Various packages will of course be best tested by various commands and sanity checks.
7. Once it looks like the update is working, commit that batch of changes.
8. Once all your changes are in, make sure to run GitHub CI and have your PR
   reviewed.

**N.B.**: if the changes required to make a package upgrade are looking
like they're going to take longer than 20 minutes to implement, don't get stuck
implementing them in the dependencies PR! Make a new PR and tackle them later,
and more in depth.
