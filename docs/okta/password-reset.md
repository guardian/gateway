# Resetting passwords and generating password reset tokens in Okta

**_Note: These diagrams are outdated and describe behaviour for the older Okta Classic API. For more up to date flows using the newer Okta IDX API, see the [IDX Documentation](./okta/idx/README.md) and the [IDX Reset Password](./idx/reset-password-idx.md) documentation specifically_**

These are some notes which might be helpful, giving an overview of the ways we reset user passwords in Okta.

All reset password operations are asynchronous and two-stage. First, we generate a reset password token within Okta. This is a short-lived token (60 minute expiry), and is emailed to the user. Then, the user posts their new password to the `/reset_password/:token` route, which will check if the token is valid and use the `resetPassword` function, which calls `/api/v1/authn/credentials/reset_password`, to complete the reset password operation.

## Generating password reset tokens

There are three ways to generate the reset password token for the first step of the operation.

| Gateway function           | Okta endpoint                                   | Original user state | Puts user into non-`ACTIVE` state | Sends an email through Okta     | Returns a recovery token         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `dangerouslyResetPassword` | `/api/v1/users/:id/lifecycle/reset_password`    | Any                 | Yes ✅ (`RECOVERY`)               | Yes ✅ (with `sendEmail: true`) | Yes ✅ (with `sendEmail: false`) |
| `sendForgotPasswordEmail`  | `/api/v1/authn/recovery/password`               | ???                 | No\* ❌                           | Yes ✅                          | No ❌                            |
| `forgotPassword`           | `/api/v1/users/:id/credentials/forgot_password` | `ACTIVE`            | No ❌                             | Yes ✅ (with `sendEmail: true`) | Yes ✅ (with `sendEmail: false`) |

\* `api/v1/authn/recovery/password` can be used two ways - as a user-initiated flow, which doesn't change the user's status, or as an admin-initiated flow, which puts them into `RECOVERY`. We use it only the first way.

We use the three functions in different contexts:

- `dangerouslyResetPassword` is used to:
  - Create a password for a social user who doesn't have one (this is the only way to do so)
  - Send a forgot password email to a `RECOVERY` or `PASSWORD_EXPIRED` user
- `sendForgotPasswordEmail` is used to:
  - Send a forgot password email to an `ACTIVE` user.
- `forgotPassword` is used to:
  - Generate a password reset token which we put into a custom email we send via Gateway to unvalidated users. For this operation, we can't use `dangerouslyResetPassword` because we don't want to put them into a non-`ACTIVE` state, and we can't use `sendForgotPasswordEmail` because we need to control the custom content of the email.
