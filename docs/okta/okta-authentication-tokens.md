# Okta Authentication API Tokens

Okta's tokens fall into two groups: the standard OAuth and OIDC (Open ID Connect) tokens and the custom tokens that form
part of its Authentication API. These are unrelated to each other and serve different purposes.

This documentation is on the Okta Authentication API tokens. See [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID connect documentation](./oauth.md#oauthoidc-tokens-claims-and-scopes) for more information on those tokens.

### Recovery / Activation Tokens

Single use tokens for performing an account recovery action. They should be distributed out-of-band to a user such as
via email. We currently use these tokens when a user requests to reset their password, or when a new user registers and
is sent an activation email. The tokens are exchanged for state tokens to complete the recovery operation.

### State token

An ephemeral token encoding the current state of the recovery operation. To use a concrete example, when a user resets
their password they are sent a recovery token by email. When they click on the link their recovery token is exchanged
for a state token. The state token is then sent on the request to reset the user's password.

### Session token

A single-use token which can be exchanged for a login session via the [OIDC & OAuth API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/)
or the [Sessions API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/sessions/)
