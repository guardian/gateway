 * @name mergeRequestState

 * unknown reason, the TypeScript checker wasn't picking up type errors on usages of vanilla deepmerge.
 * @param initialRequestState A full RequestState object.
 * @param partialRequestState A partial subset of a RequestState object.
 * @returns A full RequestState object.
